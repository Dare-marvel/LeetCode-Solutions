### [Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/)

## Explanation:
This code is a solution to the problem of finding the intersection node of two singly-linked lists. The main logic of the code is as follows:
1. First, it checks if either of the linked lists is null. If either of them is null, it returns null as there can be no intersection.
2. Then, it initializes two pointers, `a` and `b`, to the heads of the two linked lists.
3. The code enters a while loop that continues until `a` and `b` are equal.
4. Inside the loop, if `a` is null, it is set to point to the head of list `B`. Otherwise, it is moved to its next node.
5. Similarly, if `b` is null, it is set to point to the head of list `A`. Otherwise, it is moved to its next node.
6. When the loop exits, `a` and `b` will be pointing to the intersection node if there is one. Otherwise, they will both be null.
7. The function returns `a`.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both linked lists. This is because in the worst case, the while loop will run for n iterations before finding the intersection node or determining that there isn't one.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the two pointers `a` and `b`. It does not use any additional data structures or allocate any additional memory dynamically.

## Code:
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */

// This class is a solution to find the intersection point of two singly-linked lists.
public class Solution {

    // This method finds the intersection node of two linked lists.
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        
        // If either of the lists is empty, there can't be an intersection.
        if(headA == null || headB == null) return null;

        // Initialize two pointers, a and b, to traverse the linked lists.
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;

        // Traverse the linked lists until the two pointers meet, indicating an intersection
        // or until both pointers become null, indicating no intersection.
        while(a != b){
            // If a reaches the end of list A, move it to the start of list B.
            a = a == null ? headB : a.next;
            
            // If b reaches the end of list B, move it to the start of list A.
            b = b == null ? headA : b.next;
        }

        // At this point, either a and b are pointing to the same intersection node,
        // or they are both null (no intersection).
        return a;
    }
}
```
