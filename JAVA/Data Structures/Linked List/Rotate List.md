### [Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/description/)

## Explanation:
This code is a solution to the problem of rotating a singly-linked list to the right by `k` places. The main logic of the code can be summarized in the following points:

1. The code first checks if `k` is 0 or if the list is empty or has only one element, in which case it returns the head of the list as is.
2. Then, it counts the number of elements in the list by iterating over it using a `counter` pointer.
3. If `k` is a multiple of the number of elements in the list (`count`), then it returns the head of the list as is, without performing any rotation.
4. Next, it initializes two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the list.
5. The `fast` pointer is then moved ahead by `k % count` places, where `count` is the number of elements in the list.
6. After moving the `fast` pointer ahead, both pointers are then moved until `fast.next != null`. This means that when this loop exits, both pointers will be pointing to nodes such that there are exactly `k % count` nodes between them.
7. The next node after the `slow` pointer becomes the new head of the rotated list, and the original list is split into two parts at this point.
8. The second part of the list (starting from the new head) is then appended to the first part (starting from the original head) to form the rotated list. This is done by setting `slow.next = null`, which separates the two parts of the list, and then finding the last node in the second part using a `ptr` pointer. The next node after this last node is set to be the original head of the list, which appends the first part to the second part.
9. Finally, it returns the new head of the rotated list as its result.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the code iterates over the entire list once to count its elements, and then iterates over it again using two pointers to find its new head after rotation. Since each iteration takes O(n) time, and there are two iterations, this results in an overall time complexity of O(n).

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of extra space to store its variables and pointers, regardless of the size of the input list.

## Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        // If k is 0 or the list is empty or has only one element, return the head of the list as is
        if(k == 0 || head == null || head.next == null ) {
            return head;
        }

        // Count the number of elements in the list
        ListNode counter = head;
        int count = 0;
        while(counter != null){
            counter = counter.next;
            count++;
        }

        // If k is a multiple of the number of elements in the list, return the head of the list as is
        if(k % count == 0){
            return head;
        }

        // Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the list
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        // Move the fast pointer ahead by k % count places
        for(int i=0;i< k % count ;i++){
            fast = fast.next;
        }

        // Move both pointers until fast reaches the end of the list
        while(fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        // The next node after the slow pointer becomes the new head of the rotated list
        ListNode addToFirst = slow.next;

        // Split the original list into two parts at this point
        slow.next = null;

        // Find the last node in the second part of the list
        ListNode ptr = addToFirst;
        while(ptr.next != null){
            ptr = ptr.next;
        }

        // Append the first part to the second part to form the rotated list
        ptr.next = head;

        // Return the new head of the rotated list
        return addToFirst;
    }
}
```
