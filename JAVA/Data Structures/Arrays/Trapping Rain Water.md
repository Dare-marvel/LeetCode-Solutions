### [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)

## Explanation of the Approach

The problem involves finding the total amount of water that can be trapped between towers of varying heights, represented by an array. The solution employs a two-pointer technique to efficiently calculate the trapped water. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the approach and intuition behind the main logic:

#### Understanding the Problem

- **Problem Statement**: Given an array `height` where each element represents the height of a vertical bar at that index, the objective is to compute how much water can be trapped after a rain, between these bars.
- **Visualization**: Imagine each array value as a block of a certain height, and water can be trapped in the dips or valleys between taller blocks.

#### Approach and Intuition

1. **Initialization**:
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to point at the start and the end of the array, respectively.
   - Two variables, `leftmax` and `rightmax`, keep track of the maximum heights found so far from the left and right ends of the array.
   - A result variable `res` is used to accumulate the total trapped water.

2. **Logic Using Two Pointers**:
   - The algorithm uses a while loop to process elements until the `left` pointer meets or crosses the `right` pointer.
   - At each step, compare the heights at these two pointers.

3. **Trapping Logic**:
   - **If `height[left]` is less than or equal to `height[right]`**:
     - This implies that any trapped water at position `left` will definitely be bounded by a taller bar to the right, because `rightmax` is at least `height[right]`.
     - Update `leftmax` if `height[left]` is greater than `leftmax`. If not, the difference `leftmax - height[left]` represents the water that can be trapped at this position.
     - Increment the `left` pointer.
   - **If `height[right]` is less than `height[left]`**:
     - This situation mirrors the above but from the right side. Here, `leftmax` guarantees that there’s a taller or equal bar to the left of `right`.
     - Update `rightmax` if `height[right]` is greater than `rightmax`. Otherwise, compute the trapped water as `rightmax - height[right]`.
     - Decrement the `right` pointer.

4. **Loop Continuation**:
   - The loop continues, moving inward from both ends of the array, until `left` and `right` meet or cross. The rationale behind using the lesser value (`height[left]` vs `height[right]`) is that the potential water trapping at a position is limited by the shorter side that has been encountered so far.

5. **Completion**:
   - When the loop completes, `res` contains the total volume of water trapped.

#### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `height` array. This efficiency arises because each element in the array is processed at most once through the movement of the `left` and `right` pointers.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)**. The solution uses only a fixed number of extra space for the pointers and the max-height trackers regardless of the input size.

## Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        // Initialize two pointers, 'left' and 'right,' to the start and end of the height array.
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;

        // Initialize a variable 'res' to store the result (total trapped water).
        int res = 0;

        // Initialize variables 'leftmax' and 'rightmax' to track the maximum height encountered from the left and right sides.
        int leftmax = 0, rightmax = 0;

        // Iterate through the array while the 'left' pointer is less than or equal to the 'right' pointer.
        while (left <= right) {
            // If the height at the 'left' pointer is less than or equal to the height at the 'right' pointer.
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                // Check if the current height is greater than or equal to 'leftmax.'
                if (height[left] >= leftmax)
                    leftmax = height[left]; // Update 'leftmax' if the current height is greater.
                else
                    res += leftmax - height[left]; // Calculate and add trapped water to 'res.'

                // Move the 'left' pointer to the right.
                left++;
            } else { // If the height at the 'right' pointer is greater than the height at the 'left' pointer.
                // Check if the current height is greater than or equal to 'rightmax.'
                if (height[right] >= rightmax)
                    rightmax = height[right]; // Update 'rightmax' if the current height is greater.
                else
                    res += rightmax - height[right]; // Calculate and add trapped water to 'res.'

                // Move the 'right' pointer to the left.
                right--;
            }
        }

        // Return the total trapped water.
        return res;
    }
}
```
