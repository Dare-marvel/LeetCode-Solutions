### [Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/description/)

## Explanation:
The main logic of this code is to set all elements in a row or column to zero if any element in that row or column is zero. Here's how the code achieves this:

1. The code starts by declaring a variable `col0` to keep track of whether the first column should be set to zero.
2. The code then iterates through the matrix to find zeros. If a zero is found, the first element of that row and the first element of that column are set to zero. If the zero is in the first column, `col0` is set to zero.
3. The code then iterates through the matrix again, starting from the second row and second column. If an element is not zero, but its row or column has a zero (as indicated by the first element of that row or column being zero), then that element is set to zero.
4. If the first element of the matrix is zero, the entire first row is set to zero.
5. If `col0` is zero, the entire first column is set to zero.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because the code iterates through the entire matrix twice.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of additional space (the `col0` variable) regardless of the size of the input matrix.

## Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        // variable to keep track of whether the first column should be set to zero
        int col0 = 1;
        
        // iterate through the matrix to find zeros
        for(int i=0;i<matrix.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<matrix[i].length;j++){
                if(matrix[i][j] == 0){
                    // set the first element of the row to zero
                    matrix[i][0] = 0;

                    if(j != 0){
                        // set the first element of the column to zero
                        matrix[0][j] = 0;
                    }
                    else{
                        // if the zero is in the first column, set col0 to zero
                        col0 = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // iterate through the matrix again, setting elements to zero if their row or column has a zero
        for(int i=1;i<matrix.length;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<matrix[0].length;j++){
                if(matrix[i][j] != 0){
                    if(matrix[0][j] == 0 || matrix[i][0] == 0){
                        matrix[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // if the first element of the matrix is zero, set the first row to zero
        if(matrix[0][0] == 0){
            for(int i=0;i<matrix[0].length;i++){
                matrix[0][i] = 0;
            }
        }
        
        // if col0 is zero, set the first column to zero
        if(col0 == 0){
            for(int i=0;i<matrix.length;i++){
                matrix[i][0] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
