### [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

## Explanation:
This code is a solution to the problem of checking if two strings are anagrams of each other. Here is the main logic of the code in detail:

1. The `isAnagram` function takes two arguments: `s` and `t`, which are the two strings to be checked.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, it returns `false`.
3. Then, it creates an array of 26 integers to represent the counts of each character in the strings.
4. It iterates through the characters of both strings and increments the count for characters in `s` and decrements the count for characters in `t`.
5. Finally, it checks if all counts are zero. If any count is not zero, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the input strings. This is because it iterates through all characters of both strings once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is **O(1)**, as it uses a constant amount of extra space to store the counts of characters.

## Code:
```java
class Solution {
    // Function to check if two strings, s and t, are anagrams of each other.
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        // Check if the lengths of the two strings are different.
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false; // If the lengths are different, they can't be anagrams.
        }

        // Create an array to store the count of each character in the English alphabet (lowercase).
        int[] charCounts = new int[26];

        // Iterate through both strings simultaneously.
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            // Increment the count for the character at the 'i'th position in string 's'.
            charCounts[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            // Decrement the count for the character at the 'i'th position in string 't'.
            charCounts[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
        }

        // Check if all counts in the charCounts array are zero.
        for (int count : charCounts) {
            if (count != 0) {
                return false; // If any count is not zero, the strings are not anagrams.
            }
        }

        return true; // If all counts are zero, the strings are anagrams of each other.
    }
}

```
