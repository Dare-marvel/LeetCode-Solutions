### [Make The String Great](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-the-string-great/description/)

## Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `makeGood` is defined with one parameter: `s`, a string.

2. **Stack Initialization**: A stack is initialized as an empty list. The stack is used to keep track of the characters in the string that have not been removed.

3. **Iteration over Characters**: The function iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character, it checks whether the stack is not empty and whether the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the current character and the character at the top of the stack is 32. The ASCII difference of 32 corresponds to the difference between the ASCII values of a lowercase letter and its corresponding uppercase letter.

4. **Character Removal**: If the conditions in step 3 are met, it means that the current character and the character at the top of the stack are the same letter but in different cases (one is uppercase and the other is lowercase). In this case, the character at the top of the stack is removed by popping the stack.

5. **Character Addition**: If the conditions in step 3 are not met, it means that the current character does not need to be removed. In this case, the current character is added to the stack.

6. **Return Value**: After all characters in the string have been processed, the function returns the string formed by joining all characters in the stack. This is the final string after all "bad" characters have been removed.

This code uses a **stack** data structure to efficiently process the characters in the string and remove "bad" characters. The key idea is to compare each character with the character at the top of the stack and remove both characters if they are the same letter but in different cases. This is a common pattern in problems that involve processing a string and removing certain characters based on some condition. The use of a stack allows the code to process the string in a single pass and achieve a linear time complexity. ðŸ˜Š

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The **time complexity** of the code is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `s`. This is because the code involves a single loop that iterates over each character in `s` once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The **space complexity** of the code is also **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `s`. This is because in the worst-case scenario, all characters in `s` are added to the stack, so the stack can grow up to `n` characters.

## Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to store characters
        stack = []  

        # Iterate through each character in the input string
        for char in s:
            # If the stack is not empty and the absolute difference between the ASCII values
            # of the current character and the top of the stack is 32 (indicating a case difference),
            # pop the top character from the stack
            if stack and abs(ord(char) - ord(stack[-1])) == 32:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                # If the stack is empty or there is no case difference, push the current character onto the stack
                stack.append(char)

        # Convert the stack to a string and return it
        return ''.join(stack)

```
