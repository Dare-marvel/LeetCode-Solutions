### [Number of Recent Calls](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/description/)

## Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The `RecentCounter` class is initialized with a **deque** `q`. A deque, or double-ended queue, is a data structure that allows you to append and pop elements from both ends efficiently.

2. **Ping Method**: The `ping` method is called whenever a request is received. It takes one argument `t`, which represents the timestamp of the ping in milliseconds.

3. **Adding Timestamps**: When `ping` is called, it adds the timestamp `t` to the end of the deque `q` using the `append` method.

4. **Removing Old Timestamps**: The method then enters a loop that continues as long as the timestamp at the beginning of the deque is less than `t - 3000`. This condition checks if there are any timestamps in `q` that are older than 3000 milliseconds from the current timestamp `t`. If such timestamps exist, they are removed from `q` using the `popleft` method.

5. **Returning the Count**: Finally, the `ping` method returns the number of timestamps currently in the deque `q` using the `len` function. This count represents the number of pings that have occurred within the last 3000 milliseconds.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the `ping` method is O(1), which means it executes in constant time, regardless of the number of elements in the deque. This is because both `append` and `popleft` operations in a deque are performed in constant time.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of the `RecentCounter` class is O(N), where N is the number of pings within the last 3000 milliseconds. This is because all these pings are stored in the deque `q`. The size of `q` grows and shrinks as pings are added and old timestamps are removed, but at any moment, it can hold at most N elements.

## Code:
```py
import collections

class RecentCounter(object):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize a deque to store the timestamps of pings
        self.q = collections.deque()

    def ping(self, t):
        # Add the current timestamp t to the deque
        self.q.append(t)
        
        # Remove timestamps from the beginning of the deque that are older than 3000 milliseconds
        while self.q[0] < t - 3000:
            self.q.popleft()
        
        # Return the number of timestamps remaining in the deque, which represents the number of pings within the last 3000 milliseconds
        return len(self.q)
```
