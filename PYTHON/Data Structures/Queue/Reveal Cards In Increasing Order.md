### [Reveal Cards In Increasing Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/description/)

## Explanation:
This Python code is a solution to a problem where you have a deck of cards and you want to reveal them in a specific order. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The code starts by initializing a deque `index` with the indices of the deck and an empty list `ans` of the same length as the deck.

2. **Sorting the Deck**: The deck is sorted in ascending order. This is because we want to place the smallest card first, then the second smallest card, and so on.

3. **Filling the Answer List**: The code then iterates over the sorted deck. For each card, it does the following:
    - It removes the first index from the deque and places the card at that index in the answer list.
    - If there are still indices left in the deque, it removes the next index and appends it back to the end of the deque. This simulates the process of revealing a card and then putting the next card to the bottom of the deck.

4. **Returning the Answer**: After all cards have been placed, the code returns the answer list, which contains the cards in the desired order.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of cards in the deck. This is because the deck is sorted, which takes O(n log n) time. The rest of the operations (appending and popping elements from the deque and filling the answer list) take O(n) time, so the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is O(n), as a deque and a list of size n are used to store the indices and the answer, respectively.

## Code:
```py
# Importing the required module for collections
import collections

# Defining a class named Solution
class Solution:
    # Defining a method named deckRevealedIncreasing which takes a list of integers (deck) as input and returns a list of integers
    def deckRevealedIncreasing(self, deck: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Finding the length of the input deck
        n = len(deck)
        # Creating a deque (a double-ended queue) containing indices from 0 to n-1
        index = collections.deque(range(n))
        # Creating a list of n elements initialized with 0
        ans = [0] * n

        # Iterating over the sorted deck
        for card in sorted(deck):
            # Taking out the leftmost index from the deque and assigning the current card to the corresponding position in the ans list
            ans[index.popleft()] = card
            # If there are still elements in the deque
            if index:
                # Moving the leftmost index to the end of the deque
                index.append(index.popleft())

        # Returning the final list containing the cards arranged in increasing order according to the given rules
        return ans

```
