### [Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/description/)

## Explanation:
This is a Python implementation of a function `myPow` that calculates the value of `x` raised to the power of `n`. The function takes two arguments: a float `x` and an integer `n`, and returns a float value.

Here is the main logic of the code in detail:
1. The function initializes the variable `ans` to 1.0 and `power` to the absolute value of `n`.
2. It enters a loop that continues until `power` is greater than 0.
3. Inside the loop, if `power` is odd, it multiplies `ans` by `x`, and decrements `power` by 1.
4. If `power` is even, it squares the value of `x`, and divides `power` by 2.
5. After the loop, if the original value of `n` was negative, it calculates the reciprocal of `ans`.
6. Finally, it returns the value of `ans`.

Overall, this code seems to be a correct implementation of the power function using an iterative approach. However, there are some suggestions for improvement that I mentioned in my previous response.
## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this function is **O(log n)**, because it divides the power by 2 in each iteration of the loop.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is **O(1)**, because it uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size.

## Code:
```py
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        # Initialize the result to 1.0
        ans = 1.0
        
        # Store the absolute value of n in the 'power' variable
        power = n
        
        # Handle negative exponents by converting them to positive
        if power < 0:
            power = -1 * power
        
        # Perform the exponentiation using a while loop
        while power > 0:
            # If the current power is odd, multiply the result by x
            if power % 2 == 1:
                ans = ans * x
                power -= 1
            # If the current power is even, square x and halve the power
            else:
                x = x * x
                power /= 2
        
        # If the original exponent (n) was negative, take the reciprocal of the result
        if n < 0:
            ans = (1.0) / (ans)
        
        # Return the final result
        return ans
```
