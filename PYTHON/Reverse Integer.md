### [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

## Explanation:
This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `reverse` that takes in an integer `x` and returns its reversed digits. Here's the main logic of the code in points:
1. The code extracts the absolute value of `x` and stores it in a variable `num`.
2. The code initializes a variable `rev_num` to represent the reversed number as 0.
3. The code enters a loop that continues until `num` is 0. In each iteration of the loop, it multiplies `rev_num` by 10 and adds the next digit of `num`, then moves to the next digit of `num`.
4. After all digits have been reversed, the code checks if `rev_num` is outside the range of a 32-bit signed integer and returns 0 if it is.
5. If `x` was positive, the code returns `rev_num`. Otherwise, it returns the negated value of `rev_num`.

## Time and Space Compexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(log(x)), where x is the input to the `reverse` method. This is because each digit in x is processed once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is O(1), because only a constant amount of additional memory is used.

## Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        # Extract the absolute value of the input number.
        num = abs(x)
        # Initialize the reversed number to zero.
        rev_num = 0
        
        # Reverse the digits of the input number.
        while num != 0:
            # Multiply the current reversed number by 10 and add the next digit of the input number.
            rev_num = rev_num * 10 + num % 10
            # Move to the next digit of the input number.
            num = num // 10
        
        # Check if the reversed number is outside the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
        if rev_num < -2**31 or rev_num > 2**31 - 1:
            return 0
        # If the input number was positive, return the reversed number.
        elif x > 0:
            return rev_num
        # Otherwise, return the negated reversed number.
        else:
            return rev_num * (-1)
```
