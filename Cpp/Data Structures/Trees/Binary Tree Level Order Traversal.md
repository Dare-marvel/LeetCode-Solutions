### [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/)

## Explanation:
Sure, let's break down the code:

1. **Struct TreeNode**: This is a definition for a binary tree node. Each node has an integer value (`val`), and two pointers (`left` and `right`) pointing to its left child and right child respectively. There are three constructors for creating a new TreeNode.

2. **Class Solution**: This class contains the method `levelOrder` which performs a level order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) of a binary tree.

3. **Level Order Traversal**: In a level order traversal, the nodes are visited level by level from left to right. This is what the `levelOrder` method implements.

4. **Method - levelOrder**: This method takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns a 2D vector of integers representing the level order traversal of the tree.

5. **Queue 'q'**: This queue is used to temporarily store nodes of the tree during the traversal.

6. **While Loop**: The loop continues until there are no more nodes left to process (i.e., the queue is empty).

7. **Level Processing**: Each iteration of the while loop corresponds to a single level of the tree. The size of the level is the current size of the queue. A for loop is used to process all nodes in the current level.

8. **Node Processing**: For each node in the current level, it is removed from the queue, its value is added to the current level's vector, and its left and right children (if they exist) are added to the queue.

9. **Level Completion**: After all nodes in the current level have been processed, the vector representing the current level is added to the final answer.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is 'visited' once during the traversal.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is **O(n)** in the worst case. This is because in the worst case (when the tree is a complete binary tree), the queue will hold all nodes of the most populated level of the tree, which can be n/2 nodes at most.

## Code:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

        while(!q.empty()){
            // Get the current level size to process nodes at the same level.
            int size = q.size();

                root = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                // Enqueue the left child if it exists.

                // Add the value of the current node to the level vector.
                level.push_back(root->val);
            }
            
            // Add the level vector to the result vector.
            ans.push_back(level);
        }

        // Return the final level order traversal result.
