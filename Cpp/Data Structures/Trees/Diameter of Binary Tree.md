### [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/)

## Explanation:
This C++ code is a solution for finding the diameter of a binary tree. Here's an explanation of the main logic:

1. **Struct TreeNode**: This is a definition for a binary tree node. Each node has an integer value (`val`), and two pointers (`left` and `right`) pointing to its left child and right child respectively.

2. **Class Solution**: This class contains two methods, `height` and `diameterOfBinaryTree`. `height` calculates the height of the tree and updates the maximum diameter found so far, and `diameterOfBinaryTree` returns the diameter of the tree.

3. **Method height**: This method takes a pointer to the root of the binary tree (`TreeNode* root`) and a reference to the maximum diameter found so far (`int &maxi`) as input. It returns an integer representing the height of the tree.

4. **Base Case**: If the root is `NULL`, it means the tree is empty, so the height is `0`.

5. **Recursive Case**: If the root is not `NULL`, the method calculates the height of the left subtree (`lh`) and the right subtree (`rh`) by recursively calling `height` on `root->left` and `root->right` respectively. It updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `maxi` and the sum of `lh` and `rh`. It then returns the maximum of `lh` and `rh` plus `1`.

6. **Method diameterOfBinaryTree**: This method takes a pointer to the root of the binary tree (`TreeNode* root`) as input and returns an integer representing the diameter of the tree. It initializes `diameter` to `0` and calls `height` on the root, passing `diameter` as the second argument. It then returns `diameter`.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is **O(h)**, where **h** is the height of the tree. This is because, in the worst case, if the tree is skewed, the maximum depth of the recursion stack would be equal to the height of the tree.

## Code:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

// This class defines a solution for calculating the diameter of a binary tree.
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to calculate the height of the tree and update the maximum diameter.
    int calculateHeight(TreeNode* node, int &maxDiameter) {
        // Base case: If the current node is NULL, return 0.
        if (node == NULL) return 0;

        // Recursively calculate the height of the left subtree.
        int leftHeight = calculateHeight(node->left, maxDiameter);

        // Recursively calculate the height of the right subtree.
        int rightHeight = calculateHeight(node->right, maxDiameter);

        // Update the maximum diameter using the sum of left and right subtree heights.
        maxDiameter = max(maxDiameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);

        // Return the height of the current subtree.
        return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }

    // Function to calculate the diameter of the binary tree.
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // Initialize the maximum diameter to 0.
        int maxDiameter = 0;

        // Call the helper function to calculate the height and update the maximum diameter.
        calculateHeight(root, maxDiameter);

        // Return the final calculated diameter of the binary tree.
        return maxDiameter;
    }
};
