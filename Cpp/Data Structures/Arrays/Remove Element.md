### [Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)

## Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The code is written within a `class` named `Solution`. This is a common practice in C++ to organize code and data.

2. **Function Definition**: Inside the `Solution` class, there's a function named `removeElement`. This function takes two parameters: a reference to a vector of integers (`nums`), and an integer (`val`). The function returns an integer.

3. **Index Initialization**: An integer `index` is initialized to 0. This `index` acts as a pointer to the last element in the `nums` vector that isn't equal to `val`.

4. **Loop through Vector**: A `for` loop is used to iterate over the `nums` vector. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to the size of the `nums` vector.

5. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, there's an `if` condition that checks if the current element of the vector (`nums[i]`) is not equal to `val`.

6. **Element Replacement**: If the condition is true, the element at the current `index` of `nums` is replaced with the current element of the vector (`nums[i]`). Then, `index` is incremented by 1.

7. **Return Statement**: After the loop finishes, the function returns `index`, which is the new length of the `nums` vector after all elements equal to `val` have been removed.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the code is **O(n)**, where **n** is the size of the `nums` vector. This is because the code iterates over the `nums` vector once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of the code is **O(1)**. This is because the code only uses a fixed amount of space to store the `index` variable and does not use any additional data structures whose size depends on the input.

## Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to remove all occurrences of a specific value from a vector of integers
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        // Initialize an index to track the position where valid elements will be placed
        int index = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the vector of integers
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // If the current element is not equal to the specified value
            if(nums[i] != val) {
                // Place the current element at the index position
                nums[index] = nums[i];
                // Move to the next index position
                index++;
            }
        }
        
        // The variable 'index' now represents the length of the modified vector
        // containing elements other than the specified value
        return index;
    }
};
```
