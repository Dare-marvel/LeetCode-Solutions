### [Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/description/)

## Explanation:
Sure, let's break down the code:

1. **Class and Function Declaration**: The code is written in C++ and begins with the declaration of a class named `Solution`. Inside this class, there's a public function named `minPathSum` which takes a 2D vector `grid` as an argument.

2. **Grid Dimensions**: The function first determines the dimensions of the grid, `m` and `n`, which represent the number of rows and columns respectively.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: A 2D dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `m` x `n` is initialized with `0`. This array will be used to store the minimum path sum to reach each cell in the grid.

4. **Initialization**: The function then initializes the top-left cell of the DP array with the value of the top-left cell of the grid.

5. **Iterating Over the Grid**: The function then iterates over each cell in the grid. For each cell, it checks if the cell is the top-left cell. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves on to the next cell.

6. **Transition**: For all other cells, it calculates the minimum path sum to that cell by adding the value of the current cell to the minimum path sum of the cell above it (`up`) or the cell to its left (`left`). These values are then stored in the DP array.

7. **Result**: Finally, the function returns the value of the bottom-right cell in the DP array, which represents the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.

This code is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem where the solution to a larger problem depends on the solutions to smaller subproblems. The key idea here is to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and use the solutions to these parts to construct the solution to the original problem. This approach is what makes dynamic programming a powerful tool for solving complex problems efficiently. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The **time complexity** of this code is **O(m*n)**, where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid. This is because each cell in the grid is visited exactly once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The **space complexity** is also **O(m*n)** due to the extra space required for the DP array.

## Code:
```cpp
// Definition of the Solution class
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the minimum path sum in a grid
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // Get the number of rows in the grid
        int m = grid.size();
        // Get the number of columns in the grid
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        // Create a 2D vector to store intermediate results with default value 0
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));

        // Initialize the top-left cell of dp with the value of the grid's top-left cell
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];

        // Iterate through each cell in the grid
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Skip the first cell (top-left corner) as it's already initialized
                if(i == 0 && j == 0) continue;

                // Initialize variables for the minimum values from above and left
                int up = INT_MAX, left = INT_MAX;

                // Check if there's a cell above the current cell
                if(i > 0) up = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j];

                // Check if there's a cell to the left of the current cell
                if(j > 0) left = dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j];

                // Update the current cell with the minimum value from above or left
                dp[i][j] = min(up, left);
            }
        }

        // Return the minimum path sum for the last cell in the grid
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
};

```
