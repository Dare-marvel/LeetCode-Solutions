### [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/)

## Explanation:
This C++ code is a solution for generating all possible subsets of a given set of integers. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. **Class and Function Definitions**: The code defines a class `Solution` with two public functions: `helper` and `subsets`.

2. **Helper Function**: The `helper` function is a recursive function that generates all subsets. It takes four parameters: `ind` (the current index), `answer` (the 2D vector to store all subsets), `nums` (the original set), and `path` (the current subset).

3. **Base Case**: If `ind` equals the size of `nums`, it means we've considered all elements. The current subset `path` is added to `answer` and the function returns.

4. **Recursive Calls**: If `ind` is less than the size of `nums`, the function makes two recursive calls: one including the current element (`nums[ind]`) in the subset, and one excluding it. This is done by manipulating `path` and incrementing `ind`.

5. **Subsets Function**: The `subsets` function initializes `path` and `answer`, and calls `helper` with `ind` set to 0. It returns `answer`, which now contains all subsets of `nums`.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`: The time complexity is **O(N * 2^N)**, where **N** is the size of the given set. This is because, for each element, we make a decision whether to include it in the current subset or not.

### `Space Complexity`: The space complexity of the code is O(N), where N is the size of the given set. This is because we are using a single path vector to generate all subsets and the maximum depth of recursive call stack will be N.

## Code:
```cpp
// Define a class named 'Solution'
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to generate subsets using backtracking
    void helper(int ind, vector<vector<int>> &answer, vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& path) {
        // Get the size of the input array 'nums'
        int n = nums.size();

        // Base case: if the current index 'ind' reaches the size of 'nums'
        if (ind == n) {
            // Add the current subset 'path' to the answer
            answer.push_back(path);
            return;
        }

        // Include the current element at 'ind' in the subset
        path.push_back(nums[ind]);
        // Recursively call the helper function for the next index
        helper(ind + 1, answer, nums, path);
        // Exclude the current element at 'ind' from the subset
        path.pop_back();
        // Recursively call the helper function without including the current element
        helper(ind + 1, answer, nums, path);
    }

    // Main function to generate all subsets of the input array 'nums'
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize an empty vector 'path' to store subsets
        vector<int> path;
        // Initialize a 2D vector 'answer' to store all generated subsets
        vector<vector <int>> answer;

        // Call the helper function with the starting index 0
        helper(0, answer, nums, path);

        // Return the final list of subsets
        return answer;
    }
};

```
