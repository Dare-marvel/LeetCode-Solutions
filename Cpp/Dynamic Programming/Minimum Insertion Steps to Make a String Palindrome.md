### [Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome/description/)

## Explanation:
Sure, let's break down the code:

1. **Class Declaration**: The `class` named `Solution` is declared. This is a common practice in many online coding platforms where the solution function is wrapped inside a class.

2. **Function Declaration**: Inside the `Solution` class, the function `minInsertions` is declared with one parameter, `s`, which is a `std::string`. This function returns an `int`.

3. **String Reversal**: A copy of the input string `s` is made and named `s2`. The `std::reverse` function is used to reverse the string `s2`. This reversed string will be used to find the longest palindromic subsequence in `s`.

4. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n` and `m` are initialized with the sizes of `s` and `s2` respectively. These represent the lengths of the two strings.

5. **Dynamic Programming Table**: A 2D `std::vector` named `dp` is created. The dimensions of this vector are `(n+1)` by `(m+1)`, and it's initially filled with zeros. This table will be used to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences found so far.

6. **Table Initialization**: The first row and the first column of the `dp` table are filled with zeros. This represents the case where one of the strings is empty.

7. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the function is contained within two nested `for` loops that iterate over the `dp` table. For each cell `dp[ind1][ind2]`, it checks if the characters at positions `ind1-1` in `s` and `ind2-1` in `s2` are the same. If they are, it sets `dp[ind1][ind2]` to `1 + dp[ind1-1][ind2-1]`, which means it extends the longest common subsequence found so far. If they are not the same, it sets `dp[ind1][ind2]` to the maximum of `dp[ind1-1][ind2]` and `dp[ind1][ind2-1]`, which means it chooses the longest common subsequence that ends at the previous character in either `s` or `s2`.

8. **Result Calculation**: The length of the longest common subsequence, `len`, is obtained from `dp[n][m]`.

9. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns `n - len`, which is the minimum number of insertions required to make `s` a palindrome.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is **O(n*m)**, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the input strings. This is because each cell in the `dp` table is filled exactly once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is also **O(n*m)**, due to the space required for the `dp` table.

## Code:
```cpp
// Definition of a Solution class
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the minimum insertions needed to make a string a palindrome
    int minInsertions(string s) {
        // Create a copy of the string reversed for comparison
        string s2 = s;
        reverse(s2.begin(), s2.end());

        // Get the lengths of the original and reversed strings
        int n = s.size();
        int m = s2.size();

        // Initialize a 2D vector for dynamic programming
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, 0));

        // Initialize base cases: when one of the strings is empty
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = 0;
        }

        // Iterate over the characters of both strings
        for (int ind1 = 1; ind1 <= n; ind1++) {
            for (int ind2 = 1; ind2 <= m; ind2++) {
                // Check if characters match
                if (s[ind1 - 1] == s2[ind2 - 1])
                    // If characters match, extend the common subsequence
                    dp[ind1][ind2] = 1 + dp[ind1 - 1][ind2 - 1];
                else
                    // If characters don't match, choose the maximum from the adjacent cells
                    dp[ind1][ind2] = max(dp[ind1 - 1][ind2], dp[ind1][ind2 - 1]);
            }
        }

        // Length of the longest common subsequence
        int len = dp[n][m];

        // Return the minimum insertions needed to make the string a palindrome
        return n - len;
    }
};

```
