### [Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

## Explanation:
1. **Problem Statement**: The problem this code is trying to solve is to find a single number that appears only once in an array, while all other numbers appear three times.

2. **Bitwise Operations**: The code uses bitwise operations, specifically the left shift (`<<`), bitwise AND (`&`), and bitwise OR (`|`) operations. These operations are used to manipulate the bits of the numbers in the array.

3. **Outer Loop**: The outer for loop iterates over each bit position from 0 to 31. This is because an `int` in C++ is 32 bits, so we need to check each bit position for all numbers in the array.

4. **Inner Loop**: The inner for loop iterates over each number in the input array `nums`. For each number, it checks if the bit at the current bit position is set (i.e., is 1). If it is, it increments the `countodd` variable.

5. **Counting Odd Occurrences**: After going through all numbers for the current bit position, if `countodd` is not divisible by 3 (i.e., `countodd % 3` is not 0), this means that the bit at this position for the single number is set. So, it sets the bit at this position in `ans` using the bitwise OR operation.

6. **Result**: After going through all bit positions, `ans` will be the single number that appears only once in the array. It is then returned as the result.

This code is a great example of how bitwise operations can be used to solve problems efficiently. It cleverly uses the properties of the bitwise operations and the constraints of the problem (all numbers except one appear three times) to find the single number in one pass through the array. However, it also assumes that there is exactly one single number in the array, which might not always be the case. Therefore, it's important to understand the problem constraints and assumptions when implementing and using this code.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the code goes through the array once for each bit position, and there are a constant number of bit positions (32 for an `int` in C++).

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the single number and the count of odd occurrences, regardless of the size of the input array.

## Code:
```cpp
// This class provides a solution to find the single number occurring only once in an array.
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the single number.
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;

        // Iterate through each bit of a 32-bit integer.
        for(int i=0; i<32; i++){
            int countodd = 0;

            // Count the number of occurrences of set bits at the i-th position in all array elements.
            for(int j=0; j<nums.size(); j++){
                if((1<<i) & nums[j]) 
                    countodd++;
            }

            // If the count of set bits is not a multiple of 3, set the corresponding bit in the result.
            if(countodd % 3) 
                ans = ans | (1<<i);
        }

        // The result contains the 32-bit integer representing the single number.
        return ans;
    }
};
```
