### [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/)

## Explanation:
Sure, let's break down the code:

1. **Class Definition**: The code is written in C++ and starts with the definition of a class named `Solution`.

2. **Function Definition**: Inside this class, a public function named `missingNumber` is defined. This function takes a vector of integers (`nums`) as an argument and returns an integer.

3. **Variable Initialization**: Inside the function, two integer variables `ans` and `n` are initialized. `ans` is initialized to 0 and will hold the final answer. `n` is initialized to the size of the input vector `nums`.

4. **For Loop**: A for loop is set up to iterate over the indices of the vector `nums` from 0 to `n-1`.

5. **XOR Operation**: Inside the loop, the XOR operation is performed between the current index `i` and the `i`th element of `nums`, and the result is XORed with `ans`. The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns 0 if the two bits are the same and 1 otherwise.

6. **Return Statement**: After the loop, the function returns `ans` XOR `n`. This is the missing number in the array.

The logic of the code is based on the properties of the XOR operation. If we take the XOR of all the elements in `nums` and all numbers from 0 to `n`, all numbers from 0 to `n` will be XORed twice except for the missing number. Therefore, the result is the missing number.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector. This is because the code iterates over the vector once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of the code is O(1). This is because the code uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `ans` and `n`, regardless of the size of the input vector.

## Code:
```cpp
// Class definition for Solution
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the missing number in a vector of integers
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize a variable to store the result
        int ans = 0;
        
        // Get the size of the input vector
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Loop through the vector and perform XOR operations
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            // XOR the current element with its index and update ans
            ans ^= (nums[i] ^ i);
        }
        
        // XOR the result with the size of the vector to handle the missing number
        return ans ^= n;
    }
};

```
