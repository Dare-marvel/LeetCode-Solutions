### [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

## Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The code defines a class named `Solution`. This is a common practice in C++ to encapsulate related functions and data together. In this case, the class contains a single method named `singleNumber`.

2. **Method Definition**: The `singleNumber` method is a public member of the `Solution` class. It takes a reference to a vector of integers (`vector<int>& nums`) as its argument. The '&' symbol indicates that the method will operate on the original vector, not a copy.

3. **Variable Initialization**: Inside the `singleNumber` method, an integer variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the final result.

4. **Iteration**: The method then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the `nums` vector. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time, up to the size of the vector.

5. **XOR Operation**: Inside the loop, the XOR (`^`) operation is used to find the single number. The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns 0 if the two bits are the same, and 1 otherwise.

6. **Duplicate Cancellation**: The property of the XOR operation that is being exploited here is that the XOR of a number with itself is 0. This means that any number that appears twice in the vector will be cancelled out when XOR'd with `ans`.

7. **Single Number**: Since all duplicate numbers are cancelled out, the only number left is the single number that appears only once in the vector. This number is stored in `ans`.

8. **Return Statement**: Finally, the method returns `ans`, which is the single number that appears only once in the vector.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the code is **O(n)**, where **n** is the size of the input vector. This is because the code iterates over each element in the vector exactly once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of the code is **O(1)**. This is because the code uses a fixed amount of space to store the variable `ans`, regardless of the size of the input vector. The input vector is not copied, so it does not contribute to the space complexity.

## Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Method to find the single number in the array that appears only once
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize the answer variable to 0
        int ans = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the vector of integers
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Using bitwise XOR operation to find the single number
            ans ^= nums[i];
        }
        
        // Return the single number
        return ans; 
    }
};
```
