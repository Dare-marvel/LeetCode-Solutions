### [Promise Time Limit](https://leetcode.com/problems/promise-time-limit/description/)

## Explanation:
The main logic of this code is to create a new function that executes a given function `fn` with a time limit of `t` milliseconds. Here's how it works in detail:

1. The `timeLimit` function takes two arguments: a function `fn` and a time limit `t` in milliseconds.
2. The `timeLimit` function returns a new asynchronous function that takes any number of arguments (`...args`).
3. When this returned function is called, it calls the given function `fn` with the arguments passed to it (`...args`) and assigns the result to a constant called `fns`.
4. The returned function also creates a new promise called `p`. This promise will reject with an error message "Time Limit Exceeded" after `t` milliseconds.
5. The returned function returns a promise that will be resolved or rejected with the value of either the promise returned by calling the given function (`fns`) or the time limit promise (`p`), whichever settles first.

I hope this helps you understand the main logic and complexity of this code!

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it takes constant time to create and return the new function, regardless of the input size.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of memory to store the returned function and the promises, regardless of the input size.

## Code:
```js
/**
 * Creates a new function that executes the given function `fn` with a time limit of `t` milliseconds.
 * @param {Function} fn - The function to execute with a time limit.
 * @param {number} t - The time limit in milliseconds.
 * @return {Function} A new function that executes the given function with a time limit.
 */
var timeLimit = function (fn, t) {
  // Return a new asynchronous function that takes any number of arguments.
  return async function (...args) {
    // Call the given function `fn` with the arguments passed to this function and assign the result to `fns`.
    const fns = fn(...args);

    // Create a new promise `p` that will reject with an error message after `t` milliseconds.
    const p = new Promise((res, rej) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        rej('Time Limit Exceeded');
      }, t);
    });

    // Return a promise that will be resolved or rejected with the value of either `fns` or `p`, whichever settles first.
    return Promise.race([fns, p]);
  };
};

// Example usage of the `timeLimit` function:
const limited = timeLimit((t) => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, t)), 100);
limited(150).catch(console.log); // "Time Limit Exceeded" at t=100ms

```
