### [Snail Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/snail-traversal/description/)

## Explanation:
This code defines a new method `snail` on the `Array.prototype` object. The method takes in two arguments, `rowsCount` and `colsCount`, and returns a new 2D array with the specified number of rows and columns, filled with the elements of the original array in a snail-like pattern.

1. The method first checks if the total number of elements in the original array matches the total number of elements in the new 2D array (i.e., if `rowsCount * colsCount` is equal to the length of the original array). If not, it returns an empty array.
2. The method then initializes a new empty array `newArr` to hold the result, and initializes each row of this new 2D array as an empty array.
3. The method then initializes a counter variable `k` to keep track of the current index in the original array.
4. The method then enters a loop that iterates through each column of the new 2D array. For each column, it checks if the current column index is even or odd.
5. If the current column index is even, the method fills the column from top to bottom with elements from the original array, incrementing the counter variable `k` after each element is added.
6. If the current column index is odd, the method fills the column from bottom to top with elements from the original array, again incrementing the counter variable `k` after each element is added.
7. After all columns have been filled, the method returns the resulting 2D array.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(rowsCount * colsCount), because it needs to iterate through each element of the new 2D array once. 

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(rowsCount * colsCount), because it needs to create a new 2D array with rowsCount rows and colsCount columns.

## Code:
```js
/**
 * This method takes in two arguments, rowsCount and colsCount, and returns a new 2D array
 * with the specified number of rows and columns, filled with the elements of the original array
 * in a snail-like pattern.
 *
 * @param {number} rowsCount - The number of rows in the new 2D array
 * @param {number} colsCount - The number of columns in the new 2D array
 * @return {Array<Array<number>>} - The new 2D array filled with elements from the original array
