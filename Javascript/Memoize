### [Memoize](https://leetcode.com/problems/memoize/description/)

## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be explained in the following points:

1. The `memoize` function takes an input function `fn` as an argument.
2. It initializes an empty object `dictionary` to store the results of previous calls to the input function.
3. The function then returns a new function that wraps the input function.
4. This new function takes any number of arguments using the rest parameter syntax `...args`.
5. It converts these arguments to a string and uses it as a key in the `dictionary`.
6. If this key is already in the `dictionary`, it means that the input function has already been called with these arguments, so the function returns the stored result from the `dictionary`.
7. Otherwise, it calls the input function with the given arguments and stores the result in the `dictionary` using the key.
8. Finally, it returns the result.

I hope that helps!

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code depends on the time complexity of the input function `fn`. If the input function has a time complexity of O(f(n)), where n is the size of its input, then the time complexity of calling the memoized version of this function is O(f(n)) for the first call with a given set of arguments, and O(1) for subsequent calls with the same set of arguments.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is O(m), where m is the number of unique sets of arguments that the memoized version of the input function is called with. This is because each unique set of arguments results in a new entry being added to the `dictionary`.

## Code:
```js
/**
 * This function takes a function as input and returns a memoized version of the function.
 * @param {Function} fn - The input function to be memoized
 * @return {Function} - A memoized version of the input function
 */
function memoize(fn) {
    // Initialize an empty object to store the results of previous function calls
    const dictionary = {};

    // Return a new function that wraps the input function
    return function(...args) {
        // Convert the arguments to a string to use as a key in the dictionary
        const key = String(args);

        // If the key is already in the dictionary, return the stored result
        if(key in dictionary) {
            return dictionary[key];
        }

        // Otherwise, call the input function with the given arguments and store the result in the dictionary
        const result = fn(...args);
        dictionary[key] = result;

        // Return the result
        return result;
    }
}

```
