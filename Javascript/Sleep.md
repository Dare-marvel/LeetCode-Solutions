### [Sleep](https://leetcode.com/problems/sleep/)

## Explanation:
- The purpose of the code is to introduce a delay or pause in the execution of the program for the specified number of milliseconds.
- The function is declared as async, which means it will return a promise that resolves to the value specified by the resolve function.
- The await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the promise returned by setTimeout is resolved. This allows the function to effectively "sleep" for the specified duration.
- The setTimeout function is called with two arguments: the first argument is an anonymous function that resolves the promise, and the second argument is the millis parameter representing the delay in milliseconds.
- The new Promise constructor is used to create a new promise that wraps the setTimeout operation. The promise is resolved when the specified timeout duration elapses.
- The resolve function passed to the setTimeout callback is called after the specified duration, which in turn resolves the promise returned by the new Promise constructor.
- Overall, this code provides a simple way to introduce a delay in JavaScript code using promises and the setTimeout function.

## Code:
```js
// Define an async function named sleep that takes a parameter millis representing the number of milliseconds to sleep.
async function sleep(millis) {
  // Create a new promise that wraps the setTimeout operation.
  await new Promise(resolve =>
    // Call the setTimeout function with an anonymous function and millis as the delay duration.
    setTimeout(resolve, millis)
  );
  // The function will automatically return a promise that resolves when the setTimeout callback is executed.
  // The resolve function is called after the specified duration, which resolves the promise.
}

```
